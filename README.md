 This addon implements pushback to the online flight simulator Geo-FS!

 **How to use:**

 Note: This addon works by pasting it in the console, or uploading it in Tampermonkey.

 The pushback addon operates only on certain aircraft (see complete list below). To spawn the truck, click on the **PUSHBACK** button on the top of the screen, next to the **AUTOPILOT** toggle. This will open an external window with the controls.

 To make the truck appear, you must be immobile. Press the **Enable pushback** button on said window, and if your aircraft supports pushback, the truck should appear.

 Controls are straightforward: use the sliders to control speed and yaw, as well as your keyboard arrows. Up/Down control your speed, and Left/Right contorl your yaw. Stay in the external window to control the truck. Once finished with the pushback, you can toggle off the **Enable pushback button**, but closing the window works too. The **Reset** button simply resets everything to 0, so if you want to stop the pushbakc immediately, use that; it can also be uesd if the addon is a bit buggy.
